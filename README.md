# Welcome To My Awesome RSA-Factoring-Challenge Project.
This repository is an attempted mission to factorize numbers ðŸ¤”

Usage: factors <file>
- **Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.**
- **RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such thatn = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.**
