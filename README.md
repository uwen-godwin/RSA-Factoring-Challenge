# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
This repository is an attempted mission to factorize numbers ðŸ¤”

- **Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.**
- **RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such thatn = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.**
